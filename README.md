# Artwork-Navigation--Masters-
Complete project added to GitHub
This project was completed as part of my masters in Advanced Computer Science, and is the subject of my dissertation.

The project takes a novel approach to developing a solution to navigating online collections of art works. By utilising computer vision
to extract features of an artwork and then using machine learning tools we are able to map the similarites between works. This provides
the foundation of a system to then browse the collection based on similarity of style and content rather than by
incomplete and inacurate metadata.

Folder Structure

- FeatureExtractorPy: is the core code of the project including the computer vision feature extraction as well as the machine learning
                      mapping code. Python
- TateCollection: is the web scraper coded in Java used to source all of the images from the Tate's website.
